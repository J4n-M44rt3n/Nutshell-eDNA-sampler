# Assembly of the Nutshell eDNA sampler
## Tools and parts
The picture below gives you an overview of the tools and parts you'll need to assemble the Nutshell eDNA sampler to collect airborne, environmental DNA. Printable 3D files are in the [3D-files folder](https://github.com/J4n-M44rt3n/Nutshell-eDNA-sampler/tree/master/3D-files). Additionally, per sampler you'll need two plastic 6804 ball bearings, an M4 wingnut, and an M4-30 mm wingbolt. Most recently, I have bought the ball bearings [here](https://gzhearing.en.alibaba.com/), at 35 eurocent a piece. The glue I use here is cyanoacrylate glue, the squeezy needle-tipped dispenser bottle contains MEK.

## Steps

### 01 Join the threaded part to the connector part
If you printed the non-core sampler parts with ASA or PETG filament, you will be able to use MEK to weld printed parts together. I always keep a needle-topped squeeze bottle filled with MEK handy for this purpose. Drip enough MEK on the flat side of the threaded part for it to be completely covered in fluid, then wait for the MEK to soften the plastic. After about a minute the MEK will have mostly evaporated but the surface will still look wet. This is a good moment to fit the parts together, for which I use the aligning-aid printed part. Press it, then let it set for a couple of minutes.

### 02 Join ball bearings and housing parts
Glue the ball bearings into the printed top- and bottom housing parts. I used cyanoacrylate 'super' glue. The ball bearings have a top side (balls are covered with a strip to protect them from the elements) and a bottom side (no strip). Glue the ball bearings such that the top sides will face outward. Let it set for a couple of minutes.

### 03 Join the top housing part to the bottom one
If these parts are printed with ASA or PETG, you can use MEK to weld them together. Fit the parts together so the blades of the bottom part touch the surface of the top part. Flip the parts so the top part is under. Now you can use the needle-tipped MEK bottle dispenser to fill the contact spaces between the blades and the surface with MEK. Press the parts together for some twenty seconds, then let it rest for a couple of minutes.

### 04 Final assembly
After you left the bonded parts alone for a couple of hours for the bonds to properly harden, insert your filter in the core part. A bit of cotton wool would work (viscose), or a folded Whatman filter, maybe a vaseline-covered surface, whatever work best for you. Screw the core onto the connector, pass it through both ball bearings of the housing, and seal the bottom with the bottom screw part. Now fit the mounting part through the connector, and use the wingnut and bolt to fix sampler and mounting part together. You are good to go! I use tie wraps to fix the connector to a pole or branch wherever I want to collect environmental DNA.
