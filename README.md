# DNAir sampler
An easy-to-print and assemble, passive sampler for airborne eDNA capture. Works under water as well. If you would rather I make this for you instead of you spending precious time on it, this is possible; contact me at jan.maarten@yahoo.com. Building instructions [here](https://github.com/J4n-M44rt3n/DNAir-sampler/blob/master/Construction.md), 3D files (parametric and printable) [here](https://github.com/J4n-M44rt3n/DNAir-sampler/tree/master/3D-files).
